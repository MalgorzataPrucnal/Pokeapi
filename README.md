## Pokedex

POKEDEX created using Pokemon API :)

PokeApi - https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/

## What I have learned? 

* routing
* integration with API
* how to work with hooks
* integration with localStorage
* elements rendering
* components creating

For styling the tailwind.css was used.

Features:

* routing
* displaying the list of pokemons
* adding to favorites
* displaying from localStorage data in the favorites page
* detailed view of a pokemon and ability to add it to favorites
* PREV and NEXT buttons - integration with paged API
* limited number of favourite pokemons - the first added one is removed, when we add one over this limit
